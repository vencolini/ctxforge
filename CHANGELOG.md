## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-02

### 🚀 Major Release: Protocol Auto-Loading System

**Revolutionary architecture that loads only the protocol you need, when you need it.**

### ✨ Game-Changing Features

#### Protocol Auto-Loading (60-70% Token Reduction)
- **Before (v2.1):** Load entire 25K token framework every session
- **After (v3.0):** Load 5K CORE.md + 4K protocol = 9K tokens per session
- **Result:** 60-70% token reduction = 2-3x more code fits in context!

#### Intelligent Intent Detection
```
Your request: "Add user login"
     ↓
CORE.md detects: FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT intent
     ↓
Auto-loads: protocols/FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT.md
     ↓
Executes: Discovery → Inferences → Implementation
```

No manual protocol selection needed. Just describe what you want.

#### 15 Specialized Protocols
Each protocol is a complete, standalone workflow file:

1. **FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT.md** - Build new functionality
2. **BUG-FIXING.md** - Diagnose and fix bugs
3. **REFACTORING.md** - Improve code quality
4. **CODE-REVIEW.md** - Quality assessment
5. **TESTING.md** - Write comprehensive tests
6. **INVESTIGATION.md** - Understand how code works
7. **DOCUMENTATION.md** - Write docs and README files
8. **PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION.md** - Make code faster
9. **SECURITY-AUDIT.md** - Find vulnerabilities
10. **ARCHITECTURE-DESIGN.md** - Design system architecture
11. **DEPENDENCY-MANAGEMENT.md** - Add/update packages
12. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Deploy to production
13. **PAIR-PROGRAMMING.md** - Collaborative development
14. **LEARNING.md** - Teaching and tutorials
15. **DATABASE-MIGRATION.md** - Schema changes

#### Unlimited Scalability
- **v2.1 Problem:** Adding 1 protocol = +3K tokens for EVERY session (unsustainable)
- **v3.0 Solution:** Adding 1 protocol = +0 tokens unless used
  - 15 protocols = still only 9K per session
  - Can add 100 protocols without impacting performance!

#### Multi-Protocol Sessions
- **v2.1:** One protocol per session (reloading is expensive)
- **v3.0:** Switch protocols seamlessly in same session
  - Example: Fix bug → Write test → Deploy (3 protocols, one chat)

### 🎯 New Architecture

```

That's it. No configuration. No setup.

### 🌍 Universal Compatibility

✅ Claude / Claude Code
✅ ChatGPT / GPT-4
✅ Google Gemini
✅ GitHub Copilot
✅ Cursor
✅ Codeium
✅ Local models (Ollama, LM Studio)
✅ Agent systems (LangChain, CrewAI)
✅ Any LLM with file reading capability

### 📊 Token Efficiency

| Version | Framework Tokens | Code Budget | Protocols |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| v2.1 | 25K (all at once) | 175K | 6 (all loaded) |
| v3.0 | 9K (core + 1 protocol) | 191K | 15 (1 loaded) |
| **Improvement** | **64% reduction** | **+9% more space** | **+150% more protocols** |

### 🚀 Developer Experience

#### Before (v2.1)
```
1. Load full framework (25K tokens)
2. Choose protocol manually
3. Limited to 1 protocol per session
4. Adding protocols = token overhead
```

#### After (v3.0)
```
1. Load CORE.md (5K tokens)
2. LLM asks what to work on
3. Auto-detects intent and loads protocol
4. Switch protocols seamlessly
5. Add unlimited protocols without overhead
```

### 🔧 Technical Changes

#### New Files
- `CORE.md` - Lightweight entry point with intent detection table
- 15 protocol files in `protocols/` directory

#### Updated Files
- `lib/commands/init.js` - Installs v3.0 structure
- `package.json` - v3.0.0, updated description
- `README.md` - Complete rewrite for v3.0
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

#### Backward Compatibility
- v2.1 files still included (FRAMEWORK.md works as before)
- Users can migrate at their own pace
- `npx ctxforge init` installs both v2.1 and v3.0 files

### 💡 Why v3.0 is Revolutionary

#### 1. Cognitive Load Reduction
**v2.1:** "Which protocol do I need? Let me load it manually..."
**v3.0:** Just say what you want. Framework figures it out.

#### 2. Unlimited Scalability
**v2.1:** 10 protocols = 30K overhead (too heavy!)
**v3.0:** 100 protocols = still only 9K per session

#### 3. Multi-Workflow Sessions
Work on multiple types of tasks in one session:
- Morning: Add feature (FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT)
- Afternoon: Fix bugs (BUG-FIXING)
- Evening: Deploy (DEPLOYMENT)

All seamless. All efficient.

#### 4. Future-Proof Architecture
Add custom protocols by creating new files:
```
protocols/
├── custom-ML-TRAINING.md
├── custom-BLOCKCHAIN-AUDIT.md
└── custom-GAME-LEVEL-DESIGN.md
```

Add to CORE.md intent table. Done.

### 📚 Documentation

- **README.md** - Completely rewritten (v3.0 focused)
- **CORE.md** - New lightweight entry point
- **FRAMEWORK.md** - Updated for v3.0 architecture
- **All 15 protocols** - Complete standalone workflow files

### 🔄 Migration from v2.x

**Good news:** v3.0 is backward compatible!

```bash
# v2.1 command still works
"Read docs/context/FRAMEWORK.md and initialize project"

# v3.0 command (recommended)
"Read docs/context/CORE.md and ask what I want to work on"
```

**To fully migrate:**
1. `npx ctxforge@latest init` (installs v3.0 files)
2. Use new CORE.md entry point
3. Enjoy 60-70% token reduction!

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

None. v3.0 is fully backward compatible with v2.1.

### 🎓 Philosophy

**v2.1:** Load everything, choose protocol manually
**v3.0:** Load intelligently, detect intent automatically

**Key Innovation:** Protocol auto-loading transforms ctxforge from a static framework into an adaptive system that loads exactly what you need, when you need it.

## Interfaces for Next Task

[CRITICAL: Only include interfaces/contracts, NOT full implementations]

### Type Definitions

```typescript
// Only type signatures - no implementation details

type ExampleType = {
  field1: string;
  field2: number;
  field3?: boolean;
};

interface ExampleInterface {
  prop1: string;
  method1: (param: string) => void;
}
```

**Example:**
```typescript
type Product = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  sku: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  category: string;
};

type SearchResult = {
  results: Product[];
  count: number;
  query: string;
};
```

### Available Functions/Hooks

**Function Name:** `functionName(param1: Type, param2: Type): ReturnType`

**Purpose:** [One-sentence description]

**Parameters:**
- `param1`: [Description of what this parameter is]
- `param2`: [Description]

**Returns:** [What it returns and format]

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
const result = functionName(arg1, arg2);
```

**Notes:**
- [Any important behavior or constraints]
- [Performance characteristics if relevant]

---

**Example:**

**Hook Name:** `useSearch(products: Product[], searchTerm: string)`

**Purpose:** Filters products based on search term with debouncing and memoization

**Parameters:**
- `products`: Array of products to search through
- `searchTerm`: User's search input (case-insensitive matching)

**Returns:** 
```typescript
{
  results: Product[];      // Filtered products
  isSearching: boolean;    // True during debounce delay
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
const { results, isSearching } = useSearch(allProducts, searchTerm);
```

**Notes:**
- Automatically debounces input (300ms delay)
- Requires minimum 3 characters to trigger search
- Returns all products if search term < 3 chars
- Memoized - only recomputes when inputs change
- Performance: O(n) filter, tested with 5K items = 45ms

---

### Component APIs

**Component:** `<ComponentName />`

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  prop1: Type;
  prop2: Type;
  onEvent?: (param: Type) => void;
}
```

**Purpose:** [What this component does]

**Required Props:**
- `prop1`: [Description]

**Optional Props:**
- `onEvent`: [When this fires and what it receives]

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
<ComponentName 
  prop1="value"
  onEvent={(data) => handleEvent(data)}
/>
```

**Behavior:**
- [Key behaviors next task should know]

---

**Example:**

**Component:** `<SearchInput />`

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  onClear: () => void;
  placeholder?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

**Purpose:** Controlled search input with clear button and keyboard shortcuts

**Required Props:**
- `value`: Current search term (controlled component)
- `onChange`: Callback when user types
- `onClear`: Callback when clear button clicked

**Optional Props:**
- `placeholder`: Custom placeholder text (default: "Search...")
- `disabled`: Disable input (default: false)

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
<SearchInput
  value={searchTerm}
  onChange={setSearchTerm}
  onClear={() => setSearchTerm('')}
  placeholder="Search products..."
/>
```

**Behavior:**
- Clear button (X) appears only when value is not empty
- Enter key triggers onChange with current value
- Escape key calls onClear
- Fully keyboard accessible
- Auto-focuses on mount (desktop only)

---

## What Next Task Can Assume

[Safe assumptions about current state that next task can rely on]

**Example:**
- ✅ useSearch hook is fully tested and working
- ✅ Handles up to 10K products without performance issues
- ✅ All edge cases handled (empty input, special chars, no results)
- ✅ Search is case-insensitive by default
- ✅ Debouncing cleanup is implemented (no memory leaks)
- ✅ TypeScript types are complete and strict-mode compliant

---

## What Next Task Should Know

[Important context that affects next implementation - constraints, patterns, decisions]

**Example:**
- ⚠️ SearchInput component must be controlled (requires value + onChange)
- ⚠️ Search minimum of 3 characters is enforced in useSearch hook, not UI
- ⚠️ Filter only searches name + sku fields (not description) per spec
- ⚠️ isSearching flag indicates debounce delay, can show loading spinner
- ⚠️ Empty results return [] not null, UI should check .length === 0
- ⚠️ No API calls needed - search is client-side only

---

## What Next Task Should NOT Assume

[Clarify what is NOT done or NOT part of current state]

**Example:**
- ❌ Results pagination is NOT implemented (show all filtered results)
- ❌ Search history is NOT saved (will be separate feature)
- ❌ Sort functionality is NOT in useSearch (add separately if needed)
- ❌ Advanced filters (category, price range) NOT included yet
- ❌ No analytics/tracking of searches implemented

---

## Discarded Details

[Implementation specifics that future tasks don't need to know]

**These internal details can be forgotten:**
- [Internal algorithm choice]
- [Specific library version quirks]
- [Refactoring steps taken]
- [Alternative approaches considered but not used]

**Example:**
- Specific debouncing implementation (abstracted in hook)
- Why we chose Array.filter over reduce (implementation detail)
- Early prototypes with different filter algorithms
- Internal memoization approach (React useMemo specifics)
- Console.log debugging statements removed
- Initial typo in variable name that was fixed

---

## Architecture Impact

### System Structure Changes

**Added Components/Modules:**
```
[New additions to architecture]
```

**Example:**
```
/hooks
  └─ useSearch.ts [NEW] - Search state management

/utils  
  └─ filterProducts.ts [NEW] - Core filtering logic

/types
  └─ SearchTypes.ts [NEW] - Search-related types
```

**Modified Structure:**
```
[Changes to existing architecture]
```

**Example:**
```
/components
  └─ App.tsx [MODIFIED] - Now imports and uses search functionality
```

### Patterns Established

[New patterns or conventions introduced]

**Example:**
- **Pattern:** Separate hooks from UI components for testability
- **Pattern:** Pure utility functions in /utils, stateful logic in /hooks
- **Pattern:** All search-related types in SearchTypes.ts for clarity

### No Changes To

[What remained unchanged - helpful for next task to know]

**Example:**
- State management approach (still using useState)
- Component styling patterns (still using Tailwind)
- API integration layer (not touched)
- Authentication flow (unaffected)

---

## Performance Characteristics

[Performance notes relevant to future work]

**Measured Performance:**
- [Operation]: [Timing] with [data size]
- [Comparison to target]: [Met/Exceeded/Within range]

**Performance Constraints:**
- [Known limits or thresholds]

**Optimization Notes:**
- [What's optimized and what's not]

**Example:**

**Measured Performance:**
- Filter operation: 45ms average with 5,000 products
- Debounce delay: 300ms (intentional, not a bottleneck)
- Memory usage: Stable across 100+ searches
- Target: < 1 second (from behavioral spec)
- Result: ✅ Exceeds target by 22x

**Performance Constraints:**
- Tested up to 10K products (75ms)
- Beyond 20K products, may need optimization
- Client-side filtering becomes bottleneck at ~50K items

**Optimization Notes:**
- Already memoized (React useMemo)
- Already debounced (300ms)
- Algorithm is O(n) - can't improve complexity
- If needed later: Consider virtualization or server-side search

## Known Issues Carried Forward

[Issues discovered but not fixed - to be addressed later]

**Issue:** [Description]
**Severity:** [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
**Plan:** [When/how this will be addressed]
**Workaround:** [Temporary handling if any]

**Example:**

**Issue:** Special character handling could be more robust
**Severity:** Low
**Details:** Currently escapes regex chars, but doesn't handle all edge cases (e.g., zero-width characters)
**Plan:** Address if users report issues; monitor analytics
**Workaround:** Basic escaping covers 99% of use cases

**Issue:** No search analytics/tracking
**Severity:** Medium  
**Details:** Can't measure search success rate or popular queries
**Plan:** Implement in TASK-010 (Analytics feature)
**Workaround:** None - feature simply not built yet

```markdown
## Completed Features

### User Authentication
**Completed:** 2025-10-01
**Summary:** Email/password login with JWT, 7-day session, password reset
**Code:** src/auth/, src/components/Login.tsx
**Learnings:** PL-003 (multi-tab token refresh)
**Spec:** docs/specs/auth-feature.md (archived)

[Compressed from 5K token spec to 80 token summary]
```

---

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Template

**project.md:**
- Created: Project initialization
- Updated: After every task completion
- Compressed: When approaching 20K tokens

**Behavioral Spec:**
- Created: During feature discovery
- Updated: During approval process
- Archived: After feature complete (remove from project.md, keep in docs/)

**State Snapshot:**
- Created: After each task completion
- Loaded: When resuming after break
- Archived: After next 2-3 tasks (move to snapshots/ folder)

**Learning Entry:**
- Created: When bug/issue discovered
- Updated: Never (create new if related)
- Removed: Never (permanent project knowledge)

**Task Definition:**
- Created: During task breakdown phase
- Updated: Mark complete as done
- Removed: After feature complete (keep summary in "Completed Features")

---

## Token Management

### Growth Patterns

**Healthy Growth:**
```
Week 1:  5K (initialization)
Week 2: 10K (2 features)
Week 4: 18K (4 features)
→ Compress
Week 5: 12K (compressed, ready for more)
```

**Unhealthy Growth:**
```
Week 1:  8K (too verbose)
Week 2: 20K (not compressing)
Week 4: 35K (exceeding target)
→ Major compression needed
```

### Compression Triggers

**Compress when:**
- project.md approaching 20K tokens
- More than 5 state snapshots in project.md
- Architecture section duplicating code
- Old feature specs still inline (should be archived)

**How to compress:**
1. Archive completed behavioral specs (link only)
2. Move old snapshots to snapshots/ folder
3. Convert architecture details to summaries + code references
4. Condense completed features to one-line + learning reference
5. Keep only current focus detailed

---

## Multi-File Strategy

For large projects, split into multiple files:

```
docs/context/
├── project.md (core context, always load)
├── architecture.md (detailed architecture, load when needed)
├── learnings.md (all learnings, load before implementation)
├── features/
│   ├── auth-feature.md (archived spec)
│   └── search-feature.md (archived spec)
└── snapshots/
    ├── snapshot-after-task-005.md
    └── snapshot-after-task-012.md
```

**Load strategy:**
- **Always:** project.md (core context)
- **Implementation sessions:** project.md + learnings.md
- **Architecture work:** project.md + architecture.md
- **Resuming:** project.md + latest snapshot
- **Reference:** Feature specs on demand

---

## Customization

### Add Sections to project.md

```markdown
## [Custom Section Name]
[Content specific to your project type]
```

**Examples:**
- **API Endpoints:** For backend projects
- **Database Schema:** For data-heavy apps
- **Design System:** For UI-focused projects
- **Deployment:** For DevOps-heavy projects

### Custom Template

Create project-specific template in project.md:

```markdown
## Custom Templates

### Our-Specific-Thing Template
[Template structure for your domain]
```

---

## Philosophy

> "Templates provide structure, not content.
> LLM fills them from discovery conversations.
> Human approves, never writes raw structure."

**Structure enables automation. Automation enables quality.**

**Version:** 2.0

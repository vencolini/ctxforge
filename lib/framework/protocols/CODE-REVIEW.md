# Code Review Protocol

**Load this protocol when:** Reviewing code quality, security, or best practices

---

## When to Use

User requests starting with: review, check, assess, critique, evaluate, audit

Examples:
- "Review this authentication code"
- "Check if this is secure"
- "Evaluate code quality"

---

## Step 1: Load Quality Criteria

Before reviewing, establish criteria:

```
I'll review against:

âœ“ PERFORMANCE-DIRECTIVES.md (30 quality rules)
âœ“ Project learnings (past mistakes to avoid - from project.md)
âœ“ Best practices for [language/framework]
âœ“ Security considerations (OWASP, CVE patterns)
âœ“ Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1)
âœ“ Performance implications
âœ“ Maintainability and readability

Starting review...
```

---

## Step 2: Multi-Level Review

Present findings in priority order:

```markdown
## Code Review: [Component/Feature Name]

**Reviewed:** [File(s) or module name]
**Date:** [Current date]
**Reviewer:** [LLM model]

---

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Must fix before deployment)

#### Issue 1: [Critical issue name]
**Location:** [File:line or function name]
**Problem:** [Detailed description]
**Impact:** [Security risk / Data loss / System crash / etc]
**Fix:** [Specific code change needed]

```diff
- // Bad: Vulnerable code
+ // Good: Secure code
```

**Priority:** Fix immediately
**Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]

---

#### Issue 2: [Another critical issue]
[Same format...]

---

### ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT (Should fix before merge)

#### Issue 1: [Important issue name]
**Location:** [File:line]
**Problem:** [Description]
**Impact:** [Performance degradation / Accessibility barrier / etc]
**Fix:** [How to correct]

**Example:**
```javascript
// Current: O(nÂ²) complexity
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < items.length; j++) {
    // ...
  }
}

// Suggested: O(n) with Map
const itemMap = new Map(items.map(item => [item.id, item]));
```

**Priority:** Should fix
**Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]

---

### ðŸŸ¢ NICE-TO-HAVE (Consider improving)

#### Issue 1: [Nice-to-have improvement]
**Location:** [File:line]
**Problem:** [Description]
**Impact:** [Maintenance / Readability / Team consistency]
**Suggestion:** [How to improve]

**Priority:** Optional
**Effort:** [Low/Medium/High]

---

### âœ… GOOD PRACTICES FOUND

---
```

---

## Step 3: Offer to Fix

After presenting review, ask:

```
Would you like me to:

1. **Fix critical + important issues?** (recommended)
   â†’ I'll implement all security and correctness fixes
   â†’ Apply important performance and accessibility improvements
   â†’ Estimated effort: [X minutes/hours]

2. **Fix only critical issues?** (minimum for safety)
   â†’ Address security vulnerabilities and bugs
   â†’ Leave improvements for later
   â†’ Estimated effort: [X minutes]

3. **Explain issues in detail?** (for learning)
   â†’ Walk through each issue
   â†’ Show why it's problematic
   â†’ Demonstrate better alternatives

4. **Review approach only?** (no code changes)
   â†’ Just feedback, you implement fixes
   â†’ I can clarify any questions

Choose option 1-4, or tell me which specific issues to fix.
```

## Step 4: Implement Fixes (if approved)

After approval to fix:

```markdown
## Implementing Review Fixes

**Fixing in order:**

### âœ… FIXED: [Issue name]
**Change:** [What was changed]
**File:** [File:line]

```diff
- // Before: Vulnerable code
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
+ // After: Parameterized query
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
const result = await db.query(query, [userId]);
```

**Verification:** [How to verify fix works]
**Tests:** [Added/updated tests]

---

### âœ… FIXED: [Next issue]
[Same format...]

---

### FIXES SUMMARY

**Files modified:**
- [file1]: [changes made]
- [file2]: [changes made]

**Tests added/updated:**
- [test file]: [test cases]

**Before/after quality score:**
- Before: [X/100]
- After: [Y/100]
- Improvement: [+Z points]

**Remaining issues:**
- Nice-to-have issues left for future iteration
```

---

## Step 5: Document Learnings

If review revealed patterns or common mistakes:

```markdown
### PL-XXX: [Pattern or mistake found]

**Discovered:** Code review session, [date]

**Issue:**
[What pattern was problematic]
Example: "Using innerHTML without sanitization creates XSS vulnerability"

**Impact:**
[Why this matters]
Example: "Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts"

**Solution:**
[Better approach]
Example: "Use textContent for text, or sanitize HTML with DOMPurify library"

**Prevention:**
Rule: [Practice to follow in future]
Example: "Always sanitize user-generated content before rendering as HTML. Use textContent by default, DOMPurify for rich content."

**References:**
- [OWASP link or documentation]

**Category:** Security / Performance / Accessibility
```

Add to project.md under "Project Learnings".

## Example Review Session

```
Human: "Review this login component"

LLM:
I'll review against:
âœ“ PERFORMANCE-DIRECTIVES.md
âœ“ Security best practices
âœ“ React best practices
âœ“ Accessibility standards

## Code Review: LoginComponent

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

#### Issue 1: Password stored in plain text
**Location:** handleSubmit, line 23
**Problem:** Password sent to console.log, visible in logs
**Impact:** Security vulnerability - passwords exposed
**Fix:** Remove console.log, use proper logging library

#### Issue 2: No CSRF protection
**Location:** API call, line 28
**Problem:** POST request without CSRF token
**Impact:** Vulnerable to cross-site request forgery
**Fix:** Include CSRF token in headers

### ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT

#### Issue 1: Missing loading state
**Location:** LoginForm component
**Problem:** No loading indicator during auth
**Impact:** Poor UX - user doesn't know request is processing
**Fix:** Add loading state and disable button during request

### âœ… GOOD PRACTICES

- âœ“ Password input uses type="password"
- âœ“ Form validation before submit
- âœ“ Error messages displayed to user

### ðŸ“Š SUMMARY

Quality Score: 68/100
- Critical: 2 (must fix)
- Important: 1 (should fix)

Top priority: Remove password logging (security)

Would you like me to:
1. Fix critical + important issues?
2. Fix only critical?
3. Explain in detail?

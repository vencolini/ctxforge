# Landing Page Design Protocol

**Load this protocol when:** Creating or optimizing conversion-focused marketing pages

---

## When to Use

User requests starting with: landing page, sales page, marketing page, conversion page, campaign page, promotional page, product launch page

Examples:
- "Create landing page for SaaS trial"
- "Marketing page for new product launch"
- "Design conversion page for webinar signup"
- "Sales page for e-commerce product"

---

## Phase 1: Business & Audience Discovery (Ask 7 Questions)

**Don't jump to design.** Conversion optimization requires understanding psychology before pixels.

### Q1: Business Goal & Conversion Action
```
"What specific action do you want visitors to take?

Examples:
- Sign up for free trial
- Book a demo call
- Purchase product
- Download resource (eBook, whitepaper)
- Subscribe to waitlist
- Register for webinar
- Request quote

Be specific - ONE primary action per page."
```

### Q2: Target Audience & Pain Point
```
"Who is your ideal visitor and what problem keeps them up at night?

Describe:
- Role/title (if B2B) or demographic (if B2C)
- Current situation (what they're doing now)
- Biggest frustration or pain point
- What they've tried that didn't work

Example: 'Startup founders spending $5K/month on Google Ads with poor ROI,
frustrated by complexity of optimization tools'"
```

### Q3: Unique Value Proposition
```
"Complete this: 'Unlike [alternatives], we [unique benefit] for [target audience].'

What makes you different or better than:
- Direct competitors?
- Current solution they're using?
- Doing nothing?

What's your unfair advantage? (Speed, price, simplicity, results, support, etc.)"
```

### Q4: Trust & Social Proof Assets
```
"What proof do you have that this works?

Available assets:
- Customer testimonials (with names, photos, companies)
- Case studies with metrics (X% increase, $Y saved)
- Client/customer logos
- Number of users/customers
- Industry awards or certifications
- Media mentions or press coverage
- Expert endorsements
- Before/after results
- Money-back guarantee

Even if new: founder credentials, beta tester feedback, personal success story"
```

### Q5: Objections & Friction Points
```
"What would make someone hesitate before [conversion action]?

Common objections to address:
- Too expensive / unclear ROI?
- Too complicated / learning curve?
- Security or privacy concerns?
- 'Is this legitimate?' / trust issues?
- Time commitment required?
- Technical compatibility questions?
- Switching costs from current solution?

What questions do prospects typically ask before buying?"
```

### Q6: Traffic Source & Context
```
"Where are visitors coming from and what do they already know?

Traffic sources:
- Paid ads (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) - which platform?
- Social media posts - organic
- Email campaign - cold or warm list?
- Organic search - what keywords?
- Referral / partner link
- Direct traffic / returning visitors

Awareness level:
- Cold (never heard of you)
- Warm (aware of problem, researching solutions)
- Hot (actively comparing you vs competitors)"
```

### Q7: Success Metrics & Constraints
```
"What defines success for this page?

Goals:
- Target conversion rate? (if known)
- Volume target? (X signups per month)
- Cost per acquisition budget?

Constraints:
- Brand guidelines (colors, fonts, tone)?
- Must-have elements (specific partners to mention, legal disclaimers)?
- Mobile vs desktop priority?
- Page length preference (single screen vs long-form)?
- Timeline / launch deadline?
- Technical limitations (platform, CMS, existing infrastructure)?"
```

## Phase 2: Industry Pattern Selection

Based on business type, auto-select proven structure:

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
**Structure:**
1. Hero (headline, sub-headline, CTA, product visual)
2. Social Proof (logos of companies using it)
3. Feature/Benefit Grid (3-6 key benefits)
4. How It Works (3-step process)
5. Pricing Tiers or Trial CTA
6. Testimonials (3-4 with photos)
7. FAQ (address 5-7 common objections)
8. Final CTA

**Key elements:** Free trial emphasis, product screenshot/demo, integration logos, ROI calculator

**Conversion goal:** Trial signup or demo booking

**Benchmark:** 2-5% average, 10-15% top performers

---

### B2B Services (Consulting, Agencies, Professional Services)
**Structure:**
1. Hero (outcome-focused headline, authority signal)
2. Credibility Indicators (years in business, certifications, client count)
3. Detailed Case Study (problem → solution → results)
4. Process/Methodology (your unique approach)
5. Team/Founder Bio (establish expertise)
6. Lead Magnet (free audit, strategy call, downloadable guide)
7. Testimonials with specifics (industry, company size, results)
8. CTA (schedule consultation)

**Key elements:** Client logos, detailed case studies, credentials, calendar booking widget

**Conversion goal:** Schedule consultation call or download lead magnet

**Benchmark:** 5-10% average, 15-20% with strong offer

---

### B2C E-commerce (Single Product Focus)
**Structure:**
1. Hero (product image, benefit-driven headline, price/offer)
2. Urgency/Scarcity (limited stock, sale ends, exclusive offer)
3. Benefits Over Features (what it does for customer)
4. Customer Photos/UGC (social proof in action)
5. Guarantee (money-back, warranty, free returns)
6. Reviews/Ratings (star rating + written reviews)
7. FAQ (shipping, returns, sizing)
8. Final CTA (add to cart with urgency)

**Key elements:** High-quality product photos (multiple angles), customer photos, reviews, guarantee badge, scarcity

**Conversion goal:** Add to cart / purchase

**Benchmark:** 2-3% average, 3-5% for low-ticket items (<$50)

---

### Lead Generation (Webinar, eBook, Course, Newsletter)
**Structure:**
1. Hero (specific promise, what they'll learn/get)
2. What's Included (bullet points of benefits)
3. About Instructor/Author (credibility builder)
4. Who This Is For (inclusion/exclusion)
5. Social Proof (testimonials from past participants)
6. Bonus/Incentive (limited-time extras)
7. FAQ (time commitment, format, access)
8. Opt-in Form (minimal fields)

**Key elements:** Bullet-point benefits, countdown timer (if live event), testimonials, simple opt-in form

**Conversion goal:** Email capture

**Benchmark:** 20-40% average, 30-50% for free offerings

---

## Phase 3: Copy Framework Application

Select appropriate framework based on discovery:

### Framework 1: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
**Best for:** Pain-point driven offers (B2B, solutions to known problems)

**Structure:**
```
PROBLEM (Headline)
State the pain point clearly and specifically
Example: "Losing Qualified Leads Because Your Website Loads Too Slowly?"

AGITATE (Sub-headline / first section)
Amplify the cost of inaction, make pain visceral
Example: "Every second of delay costs you 7% in conversions. That's $18,000/month
in lost revenue if you're driving 1000 visitors daily."

SOLUTION (Your offer)
Present your product/service as the resolution
Example: "Our optimization service gets your site to <2 second load time in 24 hours.
No developer needed. Guaranteed results or money back."
```

### Framework 2: AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
**Best for:** Longer sales pages, new concepts needing education

**Structure:**
```
ATTENTION (Hero headline)
Grab attention with curiosity or bold claim
Example: "The 3-Minute Marketing Hack That Tripled Our Signups"

INTEREST (Sub-headline + first section)
Build interest with specific details or story
Example: "Here's exactly what we changed on our landing page, and how you can
copy this approach in under an hour..."

DESIRE (Benefits + proof)
Create desire through benefits and social proof
Example: "Join 10,000+ marketers using this framework to boost conversions
by 40% on average"

ACTION (CTA)
Clear, specific call-to-action
Example: "Get the free template now →"
```

### Framework 3: Value Proposition Canvas
**Best for:** Competitive markets, need clear differentiation

**Formula:**
```
For [Target Audience]
Who [Pain Point / Need]
Our [Product/Service]
Is a [Category]
That [Key Benefit]
Unlike [Alternative / Competitor]
We [Unique Differentiator]

Example filled:
"For early-stage startup founders
Who waste weeks building landing pages that don't convert
Our Landing Page Template Library
Is a collection of 50+ proven high-converting templates
That lets you launch professional pages in under 2 hours
Unlike generic website builders or expensive designers
We provide conversion-optimized structures based on $2M in A/B test data"
```

### Framework 4: Feature → Benefit Translation

**Rule:** Every feature must translate to user benefit

**Pattern:**
```
Feature: [What it is]
Benefit: [What it does for customer]
Outcome: [End result they care about]

Examples:

Feature: "AES-256 encryption"
Benefit: "Your customer data stays completely private and secure"
Outcome: "Sleep well knowing you'll never face a data breach lawsuit"

Feature: "One-click integration with Salesforce"
Benefit: "No coding or complex setup required"
Outcome: "Start seeing results in 5 minutes, not 5 days"

Feature: "24/7 customer support"
Benefit: "Get help instantly when you need it, any time zone"
Outcome: "Never lose revenue because you're stuck waiting for support"
```

**Application:** Use in benefits section, feature grid, comparisons

---

## Phase 5: Quality Checklist

Before considering design complete, verify all criteria:

### Conversion Psychology ✓
```
□ Value proposition visible in 3 seconds (above fold, clear headline)
□ Single clear primary CTA (not multiple competing actions)
□ Benefit-focused copy (features translated to benefits, outcomes stated)
□ Specific outcomes stated (not vague promises - use numbers/timeframes)
□ Friction points minimized (form fields <5, clicks <2, decisions <3)
□ Trust signals present (testimonials minimum 3, social proof visible)
□ Urgency/scarcity if authentic (no fake countdown timers)
□ Objections addressed proactively (FAQ covers top 5-7 objections)
□ Clear next step (visitor always knows what to do next)
□ Message match (headline reflects traffic source promise)
```

### Visual Hierarchy ✓
```
□ F-pattern layout (most important info top-left, scannable structure)
□ Above-fold hero contains: headline + sub-headline + CTA + supporting visual
□ Contrasting CTA button color (passes squint test - still visible when blurred)
□ Whitespace used for focus (not cluttered, breathing room around key elements)
□ Visual direction cues (arrows, eye gaze, pointing toward CTA)
□ Scannable content (headers every 2-3 paragraphs, bullets for lists, short paragraphs <3 lines)
□ Consistent visual language (color palette limited to 3-4 colors, consistent spacing)
□ Clear section separation (background color changes, spacing, visual breaks)
```

### Performance (Critical for Conversion) ✓
```
□ Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s (hero section fully loaded)
□ First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms (page interactive quickly)
□ Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1 (no jumping content during load)
□ Images optimized (WebP format, lazy loading, CDN delivery, responsive sizes)
□ Critical CSS inlined (above-fold styles in HTML, rest deferred)
□ No render-blocking resources above fold (async/defer scripts, font-display: swap)
□ Total page size < 1MB (ideally < 500KB for mobile)
□ Font loading optimized (system fonts or max 2 web fonts, subset characters)

Performance = Conversion impact:
- 0-2s: Optimal conversion
- 2-3s: 7% conversion drop per second
- 3-5s: 40% conversion drop
- 5s+: 53% mobile users abandon
```

### Mobile Optimization ✓
```
□ Touch targets ≥ 48px × 48px (Android) or 44px × 44px (iOS minimum)
□ Readable font sizes (≥ 16px body text to prevent auto-zoom on iOS)
□ CTA thumb-reachable (primary CTA in bottom 1/3 of screen or sticky)
□ Forms minimized (max 3-5 fields, autofill attributes, large inputs)
□ Click-to-call for phone numbers (tel: links, visible on mobile only)
□ Horizontal scrolling eliminated (responsive images, no fixed widths)
□ Mobile-first content (most important info first, progressive disclosure)
□ Hamburger menu avoided (important links visible, not hidden)

Mobile context differences:
- Intent: Higher urgency, less patience
- Attention: More distractions, shorter sessions
- Interaction: Thumb-based, one-handed use
- Connection: Possibly slower, metered data
```

### Accessibility & Inclusive Design ✓
```
□ Semantic HTML structure (header, main, section, footer tags)
□ Alt text on all images (descriptive, not decorative)
□ Color contrast WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text/UI)
□ Keyboard navigation functional (tab order logical, focus visible)
□ Form labels explicit (for/id association, not placeholder-only)
□ ARIA labels on interactive elements (buttons, links describe action)
□ Headings hierarchical (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping levels)
□ Video/audio has alternatives (captions, transcripts)
□ No color-only information (use icons + text, not just color)
□ Readable by screen readers (test with NVDA or VoiceOver)

Accessibility = Larger audience = More conversions
```

### SEO & Discoverability ✓
```
□ Meta title optimized (50-60 chars, includes primary keyword + benefit)
□ Meta description compelling (150-160 chars, includes CTA language)
□ H1 tag unique and keyword-rich (only one H1, matches page purpose)
□ URL structure clean (descriptive, hyphens not underscores, lowercase)
□ Image alt text (includes relevant keywords naturally)
□ Schema markup for rich snippets (Organization, Product, Review, FAQ schemas)
□ Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image for social sharing)
□ Canonical URL set (prevents duplicate content issues)

Even paid traffic benefits: Quality Score affects CPC, landing page experience matters
```

### A/B Testing Readiness ✓
```
□ Variant-swappable elements identified (headline, CTA text, CTA color, hero image)
□ Analytics tracking implemented (conversion event defined, funnel tracked)
□ Conversion event clearly defined (signup = account created, not button clicked)
□ Consistent URL structure (no session IDs or unnecessary parameters)
□ Version control friendly (class-based variants, not inline styles)
□ Statistical significance plan (traffic estimate, test duration, sample size)

Elements to test (in priority order):
1. Headline (biggest impact)
2. CTA text and color
3. Hero image
4. Value proposition framing
5. Social proof type/placement
6. Form field count
7. Page length
```

---

## Phase 6: Conversion Benchmarks & Goal Setting

Set realistic expectations based on industry and offer type:

### Industry Conversion Benchmarks

**SaaS Free Trial Pages:** 2-5% average
- Top performers: 10-15%
- Poor performers: <1%
- Variables: Product complexity, market maturity, traffic quality

**B2B Lead Generation:** 5-10% average
- Strong offer (free audit, template): 15-20%
- Weak offer (newsletter only): 2-3%
- Variables: Offer value, target seniority, form length

**B2C E-commerce Product Pages:** 2-3% average
- High-ticket items ($500+): 0.5-1%
- Low-ticket items (<$50): 3-5%
- Variables: Trust signals, return policy, product uniqueness

**Webinar Registration:** 20-40% average
- Free webinar (warm traffic): 30-50%
- Paid webinar: 5-15%
- Variables: Topic relevance, instructor authority, timing

**eBook/Lead Magnet Download:** 25-50% average
- Highly specific topic: 40-60%
- General topic: 15-25%
- Variables: Perceived value, form friction, traffic source

### Conversion Rate Optimization Priority

**Focus on high-impact elements first:**

```
Impact ranking:
1. Traffic quality (10x multiplier)
   - Wrong audience = 0.5% conversion
   - Perfect audience = 5-15% conversion
   - Fix: Better targeting, message match

2. Value proposition clarity (5x multiplier)
   - Unclear value = 1% conversion
   - Crystal clear value = 5%+
   - Fix: Headline, sub-headline, specificity

3. Trust signals (3x multiplier)
   - No social proof = 2% conversion
   - Strong social proof = 6%+
   - Fix: Testimonials, logos, guarantees

4. Friction reduction (2x multiplier)
   - 10-field form = 2% conversion
   - 3-field form = 4%+
   - Fix: Minimize fields, reduce steps

5. Page speed (1.5x multiplier)
   - 5s load = 3% conversion
   - 2s load = 4.5%+
   - Fix: Performance optimization

Don't optimize button color before fixing value proposition.

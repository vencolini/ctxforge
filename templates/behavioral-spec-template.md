## Overview

**One-Sentence Description:**
[What this feature enables users to do]

Example: "Users can search through products by typing keywords and see filtered results in real-time"

---

## User Scenarios (Gherkin-Style)

### SCENARIO 1: [Main Happy Path - Primary Use Case]

```gherkin
GIVEN [initial state or context]
  AND [additional precondition if needed]
WHEN [user takes action]
  AND [additional user action if multi-step]
THEN [expected system response]
  AND [additional expected result]
  AND [another expected result]
```

**Example:**
```gherkin
SCENARIO: User successfully searches for products

GIVEN user is on the product catalog page
  AND there are 5000 products loaded
  AND user sees the search box at top of page
WHEN user types "laptop" into the search box
  AND user has typed at least 3 characters
THEN product list below filters to show only products matching "laptop"
  AND results appear within 1 second
  AND count shows "Showing 47 of 5000 products"
  AND matching text is highlighted in product names
```

---

### SCENARIO 2: [Alternative Path or Important Variation]

```gherkin
GIVEN [different initial state]
WHEN [user action]
THEN [different expected result]
```

**Example:**
```gherkin
SCENARIO: User clears search to see all products

GIVEN user has searched for "laptop"
  AND product list shows filtered results (47 products)
WHEN user clicks the clear button (X icon) in search box
THEN search box becomes empty
  AND product list returns to showing all 5000 products
  AND count shows "Showing 5000 products"
```

---

### SCENARIO 3: [Error Case or Edge Case]

```gherkin
GIVEN [condition that leads to edge case]
WHEN [user action]
THEN [how system handles the edge case]
  AND [user-friendly feedback shown]
```

**Example:**
```gherkin
SCENARIO: No products match search term

GIVEN user is searching for products
WHEN user types "xyzabc123" (which matches no products)
THEN product list shows empty state
  AND displays message "No products found for 'xyzabc123'"
  AND suggests "Try different keywords or browse all products"
  AND clear button (X) is still available to reset search
```

---

### SCENARIO 4: [Another Edge Case]

**Example:**
```gherkin
SCENARIO: User types fewer than minimum characters

GIVEN user is on product catalog
  AND search requires minimum 3 characters
WHEN user types only "la" (2 characters)
THEN search does not trigger
  AND all 5000 products remain visible
  AND hint text shows below input: "Type 3+ characters to search"
WHEN user types third character "p" (now "lap")
THEN search triggers immediately
  AND results filter to matching products
```

## Interaction Requirements

### [Component/Area Name] Experience

**Visual Behavior:**
- [What user sees]

- [Visual feedback provided]

**Interactive Behavior:**
- [How user interacts with it]
- [What happens on interaction]
- [Response timing/animation]

**Keyboard Behavior:**
- [Keyboard shortcuts available]
- [Tab order/focus behavior]
- [Enter/Escape key behavior]

**Mobile/Touch Behavior (if applicable):**
- [How it works on touch devices]
- [Any differences from desktop]

- [How fast it should feel]
- [Loading states shown]
- [Perceived responsiveness]

---

**Example:**

### Search Input Experience

**Visual Behavior:**
- Search box is prominent at top of product list
- Clear placeholder text: "Search products..."
- Search icon visible on left side of input
- Clear button (X icon) appears on right when text is present
- Border highlights subtly on focus (blue accent)

**Interactive Behavior:**
- Click/tap to focus and begin typing
- Text entry updates in real-time
- Clear button (X) removes all text and refocus input
- Input remains focused during search
- No jarring UI shifts when results update

**Keyboard Behavior:**
- Tab to focus search input (first focusable element)
- Type to search (triggers after 3 characters)
- Enter key keeps focus in input (allows continued typing)
- Escape key clears search and keeps focus
- Clear button accessible via Tab key

**Mobile/Touch Behavior:**
- Touch-friendly target size (min 44x44px)
- Mobile keyboard appears on focus
- Search icon and clear button easy to tap
- No zoom on input focus

**Performance Perception:**
- Search feels instant (< 1 second)
- No visible lag while typing
- Smooth transition when results update
- No flickering or jumping

---

### Product Results List Experience

**Visual Behavior:**
- Results update smoothly without page reload
- Matching text highlighted (bold or colored)
- Each product card clearly separated
- Empty state centered with helpful message
- Result count visible above list

**Interactive Behavior:**
- Scrollable list (no pagination for this feature)
- Each product clickable to view details
- Hover states on product cards (subtle shadow/border)
- Maintains scroll position during typing

**Keyboard Behavior:**
- Tab through search results
- Arrow keys navigate between products
- Enter on focused product opens details

**Mobile/Touch Behavior:**
- Smooth scroll performance
- Cards stack vertically on narrow screens
- Touch-friendly tap targets

**Performance Perception:**
- Results appear immediately (<1s after typing stops)
- Smooth scrolling with many results
- No performance degradation with 1000+ filtered results

## Success Criteria (Testable)

### Functional Success
✅ [Specific user action] results in [specific outcome]
✅ [Another measurable result]
✅ [Edge case handled correctly]

**Example:**
✅ User can find any product by typing its name
✅ Search works with only 3 characters typed
✅ Clear button restores full product list
✅ Empty search shows helpful message
✅ Special characters don't break search

### Performance Success
✅ [Specific timing requirement]
✅ [Another performance measure]

**Example:**
✅ Search results appear in < 1 second
✅ Typing feels responsive (no lag)
✅ Smooth with 5000 products loaded
✅ No memory leaks after 100+ searches

### Accessibility Success
✅ [Keyboard navigation requirement]
✅ [Screen reader requirement]
✅ [Focus management requirement]

**Example:**
✅ Entire feature operable with keyboard only

## LLM Technical Inferences

[Section filled by LLM after behavioral spec is complete]

### APPROVED INFERENCES

[After human approval, LLM lists technical approaches here]

**Example:**

#### INFERENCE 1: Client-Side Filtering
**Confidence:** HIGH (90%)
**Reasoning:** Dataset size (5K items) + real-time requirement (<1s) suggests client-side is feasible
**Approach:** Filter array on each search term change, O(n) complexity acceptable
**Approved:** ✅ [Date]

#### INFERENCE 2: Debounce Input
**Confidence:** HIGH (95%)
**Reasoning:** Industry standard to avoid excessive processing during typing
**Approach:** 300ms debounce delay
**Approved:** ✅ [Date]

#### INFERENCE 3: Search Algorithm
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (75%)
**Reasoning:** Case-insensitive substring match inferred from scenarios
**Approach:** toLowerCase() + includes() on product name and description
**Approved:** ✅ [Date]

#### INFERENCE 4: Component Structure
**Confidence:** MEDIUM (70%)
**Reasoning:** Two distinct behaviors suggest two components
**Approach:**
- SearchInput component (input handling)
- ProductList component (results display)
**Approved:** ✅ [Date]
